# zola-blog
I am experimenting with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) as a static site generator, recreating a [similar project](https://github.com/Steve-Z/jekyll-netlifycms-experiment) with Jekyll. I have deployed this on Netlify, but this is only an empty template/example of a travel blog, with little real content, mostly placeholders.
